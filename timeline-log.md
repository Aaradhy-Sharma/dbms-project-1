Added normal and dbnormal() function and procedure respectively to the database. normal() is used to check the current highest normalisation form of a table taken as input(tablename) and dbnormal() takes db name (proj) in our case as input and then proceeds to call normal() for all the tables present in the database.

Tried fixing the error of undefined values being sent to the backend in response to crud/edit operations being performed in the frontend. I have been unsuccessful in trying to find a fix for the same despite spending multiple hours on the same. The same is left for the other team members to try and resolve in the remainder time.
